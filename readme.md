# about this repo
This will contain my solution to leetcode problem <br>
i will be doing it everyday atleast one question
i will also be doing every problem in several programming languages


notes : in the settings.json files i added a settings so that the file solution will be considered as a plain text becauses if we uses the leetcode template within a code editor it will give an error
